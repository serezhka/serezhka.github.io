{:  style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.8rem"}

This project was inspired by idea to mirror mobile phone screen to car display without buying additional hardware.
I have tried to implement this for the android first and later for ios. I analyzed the traffic between the iPhone
in AirPlay mode and the Apple TV in order to understand and reproduce the media content transfer protocol,
encryption and device discovery method. The architecture is designed to create receivers on new platforms with minimal effort \
